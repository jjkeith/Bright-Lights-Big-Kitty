The goal is earn enough money on establishments to buy the WCAT Television Station.

####Inspiration
After playing Machi Koro, a Japanese card game where players act as mayors and invest in infrastructure, my  seven-year-old daughter wanted to create a similar game, but with her favorite animal: cats. 

Together, we created new rules for gameplay that both simplified the game for younger players and sped up game play. She turned in a paper version of the game for a school project (then named "Cat Race to the Fashion Show") and I set about making a web-based version with a new title and some new cards. 

####Methods

My original plan for laying out the screen was to put player info at the bottom of the page as below. However, I switched it around because I felt that having that information at the top was more intuitive.
